genomic data. The Nextstrain team analyzes these data on a global and continental
level. More specific analysis are often performed by groups around the world.
This page lists publicly available SARS-CoV-2 analyses that use Nextstrain from
groups all over the world. In addition to exploring SARS-CoV-2 evolution
in finished analyses, you can use our new Nextclade tool to compare your sequences
to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence, assign them to clades, and see where they fall
on a the SARS-CoV-2 tree.`;
